Melbourne Cocoaheads History
==========================

Originally compiled by Jesse Collis. Thanks to Gareth Townsend and Sean Woodhouse for organising all the speakers over the years.

The reason it's up on github is so you can fork it, fix it up and send me pull requests. 

### TODOs

- Fix formatting
- Complete 2013 speakers
